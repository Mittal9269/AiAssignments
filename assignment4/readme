To run our program, ensure that you have g++ compiler of version greater than 11

If your default g++ compiler is of version greater than equal to 11. Then change the command in makefile to g++ from g++-11

Now, to start running our program, first run:
make build

This will generate the genetic executable file.

After this, run the command
./runme.sh <filename>

where filename is the name of the input file

The output would be stored in the output.txt file.
