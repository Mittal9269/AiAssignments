# Our Artificial Intelligence Lab work

For every assignment, the details of the task has been given and uploaded as a pdf. Overall, in Assignment 1, we implement BFS, DFS and DFID (uninformed search) in a maze. In Assignment 2, we implement Complete Search (with different heuristic functions) for Block World Domain game. In Assignment 3, we implement Beam Search and Tabu Search for Random n-SAT problem. Both of these search techniques fall under incomplete search. In Assignment 4, Genetic Algorithm is implemented for finding best Euclidean path. In Assignment 5, we implement min-max Algorithm and alpha-beta pruning search techniques. Finally, in assignment 6, we implement Logistic regression on spam mails.
